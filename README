xdimmer

===============================================================================

xdimmer is a lightweight X11 utility to dim the screen backlight when idle,
then brighten it back up when mouse or keyboard activity is detected.  This
power-saving behavior is common on other operating systems and in bloated
X11 frameworks like GNOME.

xdimmer works independently of any screen saver/locker such as xidle or
xautolock, so it is free to dim the screen prior to the existing locker
firing, and brighten it back up once movement is detected while the screen
is still locked.


Implementation
===============================================================================

xdimmer uses the XSync extension to create an alarm on the IDLETIME system
counter.  When the idle counter reaches the requested interval, it fires an X
event, causing xdimmer to dim the screen to the requested percentage (in
graceful steps) using Xrandr.

While the screen is dim, another alarm is created to fire when the XSync
idle counter resets due to mouse or keyboard activity.  When this alarm
fires, the backlight is returned to its previous level (also in steps, but
quicker).
